# JARVIS 
JARVIS is an AI assistant mobile application built using Flutter, using OpenAI API to chat with the users. Type in a prompt and get your answers right away. JARVIS uses the OpenAI API to post requests and fetch responses

## How to run the project on your local machine 
1. Ensure that you have appropriate development environment set up for Flutter development. For additional information see the official Flutter docs.
2. In the root directory, create a `.env file` and type the following: `OPEN_AI_API_KEY = "your_own_api_key"`.
3. Run `flutter build apk --release` in the terminal. A release apk will be created (Note: It will take quite some time) and its path will be shown on the terminal.
4. Transfer the apk to your mobile, install and run/test the application. (Note that you may have to allow installation from unknown sources in your mobile settings.)
