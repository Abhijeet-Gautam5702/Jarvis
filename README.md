## How to run the project on your local machine

2. In the root directory, create a `.env file` and type the following: `OPEN_AI_API_KEY = "your_own_api_key"`.
3.  Run `flutter build apk --release` in the terminal. A release apk will be created and its path will be shown on the terminal.
4. Transfer the apk to your mobile, install and run the application. (Note that you may have to allow installation from unknown sources in your mobile settings.)
